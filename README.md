# qtxr javascript utilities

This is a read-only repository containing source code for javascript utilities used by old versions of qtxr software. The code is not maintained and is provided for reference only. There are useful lessons to be learned from the code, but it is not recommended to use it in production. Though fairly advanced for its time, using these utilities would now be considered an anti-pattern.
